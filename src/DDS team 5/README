1.  Make sure that EchoClient and EchoServer is set up to be able to have multiple instances
    do this (for IntelliJ ide) by going to Run, Edit Configurations, Check the box that Allows Multiple Instances.
    This will allow us to have four clients and two servers.

2.  Run EchoServer. The maximum is three servers
	- Make sure that EchoServer is configured to run with the server_config.json in its arguments

3.  Run EchoClient. The server ip is localhost.

4.  The server port is created in the EchoServer.

5.  Type messages.  The server will echo the messages typed at the
    client, and will indicate which client sent each message:

    view - print data structure
    log (client/server) - prints the client or server logs
    add (number) - adds number to the end of indexed list
    remove (index) - removes index from the list
    insert (number) (index) - inserts a number at a given time
    commit - saves current data structures
    rollback - loads previously saved data structure
    EXIT - closes the client
